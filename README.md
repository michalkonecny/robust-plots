# Robust plots

Web app to plot robust enclosures of regular and parametric graphs. The friendly and easy to user interface allows you to draw graphs with any simple expression you can think of.

## Examples

<div>
<img src="./docs/screenshots/roughPlot1.png" height="200" width="300">
<img src="./docs/screenshots/robustPlot1.png" height="200" width="300">
</div>

The above images are that of the graph `y=(1+x^2)^(sin(10*x))-1`. The left images shows the rough version and the right shows the robust. The robust version was obtained by drawing shapes that reliably enclose the exact objects. In particular, rounding errors are correctly accounted for. These graphical enclosures can be computed to an arbitrarily high accuracy. In the case of above it was to a 10th of a pixel.
In the images below the same objects are plotted with a low accuracy so that the shapes are easy to see. In this case accurate to 40 pixels.
